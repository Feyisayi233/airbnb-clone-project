### üìå Why Identifying Design Properties Matters

Understanding and documenting the **color styles** and **typography** in a mockup design is critical to maintaining **visual consistency**, **brand identity**, and **design-to-code accuracy**. It ensures that:
- Developers can implement styles exactly as intended by the designer.
- UI components remain cohesive across different pages and devices.
- The product delivers a professional and unified user experience.
- Accessibility and readability standards are upheld.

This alignment between design and implementation is essential for creating polished, user-friendly interfaces.

## üë• Project Roles and Responsibilities

To ensure clarity and efficiency throughout the development process, each team member is assigned a well-defined role with specific responsibilities. This helps foster collaboration, accountability, and smooth project delivery.

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------------------|
| **Project Manager** | Oversees the entire project timeline, ensures deliverables are met, coordinates tasks among team members, manages risks, and communicates progress with stakeholders. |
| **Frontend Developers** | Build and maintain the user interface using React and related technologies. Implement responsive design, integrate UI components, and ensure consistency with the design system. |
| **Backend Developers** | Design and develop APIs, manage database structure, implement core business logic, and handle user authentication, data validation, and server-side processing. |
| **Designers** | Create mockups and high-fidelity prototypes using Figma. Define design systems, ensure brand consistency, and deliver assets that guide frontend development. |
| **QA/Testers** | Write and execute unit, integration, and end-to-end test cases. Identify bugs, verify fixes, and ensure the application meets quality standards across devices. |
| **DevOps Engineers** | Handle CI/CD pipeline, manage deployment environments, monitor performance, and maintain server and infrastructure reliability. |
| **Product Owner** | Defines the product vision, prioritizes features, writes user stories, and acts as the voice of the customer. Ensures the product meets business needs. |
| **Scrum Master** | Facilitates daily standups, sprint planning, and retrospectives. Removes team blockers, enforces Agile principles, and ensures smooth sprint execution. |

Each role contributes uniquely to building a scalable, high-quality product. Collaboration across all roles ensures we meet both technical and user-centered goals.
